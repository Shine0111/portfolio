    summary:
      "This project marks the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript. By clicking the Demo button, you can dive straight into a highly addictive and simple game that showcases the power and flexibility of OOP concepts.",
    motivation:
      "As a developer, I often find that the concepts I learn can fade if not applied regularly. This project was born out of a desire to solidify my understanding of OOP by putting theory into practice. It serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration of my skills in using classes, objects, and the advanced features of JavaScript.",
    futurePlans:
      "This is just the starting point. I have many ideas for expanding this project, including adding new game mechanics, improving the user interface, and incorporating more advanced OOP features.",
